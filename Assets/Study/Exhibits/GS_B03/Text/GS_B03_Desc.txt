The bust was made around 1793, is a large bust piece and stands on a simple round base. Klytia is protruding from a calyx of flowers. She has her head tilted slightly to the lower right and her lips are closed. This makes her facial expression appear sad and disappointed. The sitter is wearing a buttoned robe of translucent chiton slipped off her left shoulder, which leaves her left breast partially exposed. There is a prominent fold of robe above the cleavage. Klytia wears long hair, parted in the middle and knotted at the back of her head, leading in wide strands to the nape of her neck. The ends of the hair fall to the back of the shoulders. According to legend, the depicted Clytia was the lover of Helios, who left her for Leukothoe. The spurned Klytia was transformed into a flower, the Heliotrope, which always turns its blossoms towards the sun. Klytia still loves Helios.
