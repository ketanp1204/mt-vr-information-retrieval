The Medusa was made by Johann Adam Heinrich Oedenthal (1791-1876) as a chalk drawing in 1829. The drawing was painted on gray paper with chalk after the original Roman sculpture. In Goethe's time, the head of Medusa was considered one of the main works of the Cologne "Wallrafianum", in which not only medieval paintings, but also ancient sculptures were exhibited. In the 19th century, it was mistaken for a Greek work. This was also the case with Johanna Schopenhauer, who gave Goethe Medusa as a gift in January 1830.
