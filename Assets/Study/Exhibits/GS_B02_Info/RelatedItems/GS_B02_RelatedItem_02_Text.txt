This Medusa sculpture was executed by the Italian sculptor Gian Lorenzo Bernini. It is likely to have been executed in the 1640s. Unlike other depictions of the Medusa, this is not portrayed as a vanquished figure with her head severed from her body, but as a living monster. Nothing is known about its creation, and parts of the sculpture’s execution undermine Bernini’s authorship of the sculpture, most notable the heavy, exaggerated eyebrows and the rough treatment of the snakes. Yet the sensual fleshy quality of the cheeks and lip, the polished precision of the face, the tormented face of the Medusa and lively intelligence behind the literary concept and its unusual treatment point to the work of Bernini.
