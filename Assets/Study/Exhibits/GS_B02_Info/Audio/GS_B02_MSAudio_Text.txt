The mask of Medusa, also called Gorgon, is made of white plaster. It measures 39.5 cm and stands on a round base. The artist is unknown. The Medusa Rondanini is currently located in the Glyptothek in Munich, Germany. It was noticed and first brought to the attention of Northern European art connoisseurs in the 1780s by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. The mask can be seen in the Yellow Hall of Goethe's residence. The Medusa Rondanini may be a Roman copy of a classical work of the fifth century BC, a model attributed to one or another Athenian sculptor of the age of Phidias. Alternatively, it may have been modeled after a classicising Hellenistic work of the late fourth century BC. If it is of the fifth century, it is the first of the 'beautiful gorgoneion' type to appear in Greek art by more than a century, and unparalleled in any contemporaneous representation of the Medusa head.
