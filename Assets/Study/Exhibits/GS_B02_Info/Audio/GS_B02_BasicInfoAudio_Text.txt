The mask of Medusa, also called Gorgon, is made of white plaster. It measures 39.5 cm and stands on a round base. The artist is unknown. The original marble Medusa Rondanini, possibly created in the fifth century BC, is currently located in the Glyptothek in Munich, Germany. It was noticed and first brought to the attention of Northern European art connoisseurs in the 1780s by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. The mask can be seen in the Yellow Hall of Goethe's residence.
