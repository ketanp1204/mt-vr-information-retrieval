The Medusa Rondanini may be a Roman copy of a classical work of the fifth century BC, a model attributed to one or another Athenian sculptor of the age of Phidias. Alternatively, it may have been modeled after a classicising Hellenistic work of the late fourth century BC. If it is of the fifth century, it is the first of the 'beautiful gorgoneion' type to appear in Greek art by more than a century, and unparalleled in any contemporaneous representation of the Medusa head.
