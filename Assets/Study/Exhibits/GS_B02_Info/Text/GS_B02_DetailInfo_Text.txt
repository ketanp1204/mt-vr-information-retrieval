Medusa's even facial features are characterized by a strong round chin, bulging lips, a sharply drawn nose and almond-shaped eyes. Wild, thick locks of hair wreath the face. The snakes, Medusa's distinguishing feature, tie themselves around her face and cheeks. Above the forehead there are horizontally placed wings that emerge from the curls. Two snake ends converge under the chin and are intertwined.
