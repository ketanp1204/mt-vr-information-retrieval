The marble original bust of Clytia, on display in the British Museum in London. In 1772, Charles Townley, one of the co-founders of the British Museum, acquired the bust from a collection of nobility in Naples, with which he was so in love that he supposedly took it personally from his house during a riot in London as the only piece of his collection to safety.
