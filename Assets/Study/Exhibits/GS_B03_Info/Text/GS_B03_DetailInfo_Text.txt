The bust was created around 1793, is a large breastpiece and stands on a simple, round base. Clytia protrudes from a calyx. Her head is tilted slightly to the lower right and her lips are closed. As a result, her facial expression looks sad and disappointed. Above the décolleté there is a distinctive pleat. Clytia wears long, middle-parted hair knotted at the back of her head, which leads in broad strands to the nape of her neck. The ends of the hair fall to the back of the shoulders. According to legend, the depicted Clytia was the mistress of Helios, who left her for Leucothoe. The spurned Clytia was transformed into a flower, into the heliotrope, which always turns its blossoms towards the sun. Clytia still loves Helios.
