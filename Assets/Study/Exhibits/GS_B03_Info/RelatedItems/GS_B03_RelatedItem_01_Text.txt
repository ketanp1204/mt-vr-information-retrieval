The original marble bust on display at the British Museum in London, from the collections of Charles Townley. He acquired the sculpture from the family of Principe Laurenzano in 1772 in Naples. He paid 500 Ducats for it, which he reckoned to be £98, and shipped it home to England on the 'Lovely Betsy'. On arrival in the UK it was valued by customs at £3 and incurred a duty of 19s. 6d.
