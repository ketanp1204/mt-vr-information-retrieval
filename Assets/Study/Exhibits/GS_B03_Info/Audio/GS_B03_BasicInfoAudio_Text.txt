When visitors enter Goethe's residence in Weimar, they immediately see the plaster bust of Clytia, "the dearest little head", as Goethe called it in 1793. The marble portrait of the young woman, now in the British Museum in London, has been one of the famous works of art since that time, and countless casts populated castles and gardens as well as living rooms of the educated bourgeoisie in the 19th century.
