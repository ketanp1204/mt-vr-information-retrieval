Immediately after the bust appeared in the 18th century, the sunflower-like calyx led to the name Clytia, in the mythology of a lover of the sun god Phoebus Apollo, who - according to Ovid's Metamorphoses - was finally transformed into a flower that is always oriented towards the beloved sun, the solstice. At that time, however, it was confused with the sunflower. Around the middle of the 19th century, doubts arose about the ancient origin of the bust and it is still disputed in research today whether it is an ancient work or a work from the 18th century.
