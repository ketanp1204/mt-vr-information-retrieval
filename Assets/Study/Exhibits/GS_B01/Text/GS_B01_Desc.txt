Phokion
The Phokion bust is a copy of the Greek original, which Goethe himself saw in Rome. So Goethe did not acquire the original. You can find the bust in the Yellow Room of Goethe's residence. One recognizes a man wearing a toga and a war helmet. He has curly, long hair and a beard. The copy of the sculpture was made of plaster. The original was made in the first half of the fourth century BC.  In my opinion, he is sad because he is looking down and making big eyes. It's also kind of weird because he has the helmet on his head pushed back. The sculptor did a brilliant job though, because what he did with the hair is incredible. They look so soft, which they really aren't. The beard is also impressively done.
