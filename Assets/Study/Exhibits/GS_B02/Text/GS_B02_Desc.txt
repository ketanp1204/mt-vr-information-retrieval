The mask of Medusa, also called Gorgo, is made of white plaster. Two wings grow from her head, and her hair is made of flames. The snakes, Medusa's distinguishing feature, knot around her face and cheeks. The mask measures 39.5 cm and stands on a round base. The artist is unknown. The first evidence of this work was around 460 BC in Athens. Goethe admired the original in the Palazzo Rondanini in Rome. Later this came to the Glyptothek in Munich. J. W. von Goethe asked the crown prince Ludwig I. for a cast. As a result, a plaster mask from Rome was sent to him. You can see the mask of Medusa in the Yellow Room of Goethe's residence.
